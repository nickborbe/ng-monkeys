<p>
  edit-monkey works!
</p>

<!-- gonna put this component inside a modal in the monkey details component and use
a behavriosubject in the truth service to keep track of whether im editing or not
and based on that, show the modal or dont show the modal
also, gonna use 2 way binding so as people fill shit in in the form in the modal,
they see that shit in the monkdey details page behind  -->
